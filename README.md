# LRRRdiagnostics
LRRR diagnostics has the appendices for the manuscript entitled ``Model Fit Statistics and Diagnostics for Logistic Reduced Rank Regression''

There are four pdf files, each one corresponding to one appendix of the manuscript:
1) Appendix1_benchmark.pdf: shows the generation and analysis of the benchmark data set.
2) Appendix2_outlier_gauge.pdf: shows the creation of some outliers in the benchmark data set and the assessment of it with the diagnostics.
3) Appendix3_nonlinear_gauge.pdf: generates data with nonlinear models and checks whether the component plus residual plots catches these nonlinear effects.
4) drug_consumption.pdf : Shows the complete analysis for the drug consumption data with all fit statistics and diagnostic indices.
